              <h4>How to use this tool</h4>
	    		     <p>The quiz tool is powered by Google Spreadsheets. Editors use a Google Spreadsheet Template to input the content of the quiz. For each question, they enter the question text, four choices, an optional question description, the correct answer, incorrect message, correct message and a hint. Once the editor is done, they publish the spreadsheet to the web and grab its public URL.</p>
              <h4>How do I make a quiz?</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Follow <a href="http://quiz-generator.voxmedia.com/" target="_blank">this link</a> to the quiz generator or use the frame below.</li>
                  <li>Use the linked Google Spreadsheet Template to add your own questions to the quiz in the corresponding format.</li>
                  <li>Publish the spreadsheet to the web (File > Publish to the web), and grab the public URL for the spreadsheet.</li>
                  <li>Copy and paste the spreadsheet's public URL into Quiz Quartet and pick the vertical you will be publishing to with the radio buttons. Scroll down the page to see a preview of the quiz.</li>
                </ol>

              <h4>How do I embed a quiz into Chorus?</h4>
                <p>When you're ready to publish, copy the embed code generated by the authoring tool and paste it into the HTML view of an article page in Chorus.</p>

              <h4>What if I want to make changes to my quiz?</h4>
              <p>Update the spreadsheet accordingly, then recopy and paste the spreadsheet's public URL into the generator. Click 'Generate Your Quiz' again to get your new embed code. Copy and paste the embed code into Chorus as described above.*</p>

              <h4>Why aren't edits automatically reflected in the embed code?</h4>
              <p>In order to make the tool more reliable, Quiz Quartet pulls in the quiz data from the Google Spreadsheet and attaches it in the embed code. This means that the quiz code will need to be regenerated every time changes are made, however the quiz will be more stable in that it does not rely as heavily on communicating with Google Spreadsheets every time it loads.</p>
